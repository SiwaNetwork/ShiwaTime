# ShiwaTime Compilation Fixes Report

## Overview
This document details the compilation issues that were present in the ShiwaTime project and the fixes that were applied to resolve them. The issues were primarily related to interface mismatches between the clock manager, HTTP/CLI servers, and protocol handlers.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Clock Manager Interface Issues

#### Problem
- The HTTP and CLI servers expected `GetSources()` to return two values (primarySources, secondarySources)
- Missing `GetSelectedSource()` method in the Manager
- Missing tracking of the currently selected time source

#### Fix Applied
**File: `internal/clock/manager.go`**
- Added `selectedSource` field to the Manager struct
- Implemented `GetSelectedSource()` method
- Added `GetSourcesByPriority()` method that returns primary and secondary sources based on weight
- Updated `synchronizeClock()` method to track the currently selected source

```go
// Added to Manager struct
selectedSource protocols.TimeSourceHandler // Currently selected time source

// New methods added
func (m *Manager) GetSelectedSource() protocols.TimeSourceHandler
func (m *Manager) GetSourcesByPriority() (map[string]protocols.TimeSourceHandler, map[string]protocols.TimeSourceHandler)
```

### 2. HTTP Server Issues

#### Problem
- Wrong method calls: `GetSources()` expected to return two values
- Missing `protocols` package import
- Incorrect usage of `source.Status.Active` and `source.ID` fields
- Type conversion functions expecting wrong types

#### Fix Applied
**File: `internal/server/http.go`**
- Added missing `import "github.com/shiwatime/shiwatime/internal/protocols"`
- Updated all `GetSources()` calls to use `GetSourcesByPriority()`
- Rewrote `convertSources()` and `convertSource()` functions to work with `protocols.TimeSourceHandler` interface
- Fixed source iteration to use map names as IDs
- Updated status access to use `GetStatus().Connected` instead of `Status.Active`

```go
// Before
func convertSource(source *clock.TimeSource) TimeSourceResponse

// After  
func convertSource(name string, handler protocols.TimeSourceHandler) TimeSourceResponse
```

### 3. CLI Server Issues

#### Problem
- Same `GetSources()` interface mismatch
- Direct access to non-existent fields like `source.ID`, `source.Protocol`, `source.Status`

#### Fix Applied
**File: `internal/server/cli.go`**
- Updated to use `GetSourcesByPriority()` instead of `GetSources()`
- Fixed source iteration to work with maps instead of slices
- Updated to use handler methods (`GetConfig()`, `GetStatus()`, `GetTimeInfo()`) instead of direct field access
- Added logic to find source names for the selected source

### 4. Web Server Issues

#### Problem
- Incorrect type assertions: `*protocols.PtpHandler` vs `protocols.PTPHandler`
- Missing or incorrect interface method names

#### Fix Applied
**File: `internal/server/web.go`**
- Fixed PTP handler type assertion: `handler.(*protocols.PtpHandler)` → `handler.(protocols.PTPHandler)`
- Fixed PPS handler type assertion and method names:
  - `GetEventCount()` → `GetPulseCount()`
  - `GetLastEvent()` → `GetLastPulseTime()`
- Removed PHC handler type assertion (no interface defined) and added TODO comment

### 5. Configuration Issues

#### Problem
- Reference to non-existent `config.Priority` field in `GetSourcesByPriority()`

#### Fix Applied
**File: `internal/clock/manager.go`**
- Changed priority logic to use `config.Weight` field instead of non-existent `config.Priority`
- Updated logic: sources with weight >= 5 are considered primary, < 5 are secondary

### 6. Main Function Issues

#### Problem
- Wrong number of parameters and return values for `clock.NewManager()`
- Wrong config type passed to `NewManager()`

#### Fix Applied
**File: `cmd/shiwatime/main.go`**
- Fixed call from `clock.NewManager(cfg, logger, metricsClient)` to `clock.NewManager(cfg.ShiwaTime, logger)`
- Removed error handling for `NewManager()` since it only returns a Manager, not (Manager, error)

## Interface Compatibility Summary

### TimeSourceHandler Interface
The protocol handlers properly implement the `TimeSourceHandler` interface with these methods:
- `Start() error`
- `Stop() error`
- `GetTimeInfo() (*TimeInfo, error)`
- `GetStatus() ConnectionStatus`
- `GetConfig() config.TimeSourceConfig`

### Protocol-Specific Interfaces
- **PTPHandler**: Correctly implemented and used for PTP-specific methods
- **PPSHandler**: Correctly implemented with proper method names
- **PHCHandler**: Not implemented (marked as TODO for future enhancement)

## Build Status
After applying all fixes:
- ✅ All compilation errors resolved
- ✅ `go build ./...` succeeds
- ✅ Main binary builds successfully
- ✅ Application runs and displays help correctly

## Testing Verification
```bash
$ go build ./...
# Success - no errors

$ go build -o shiwatime ./cmd/shiwatime  
# Success - binary created

$ ./shiwatime --help
# Success - displays help information
```

## Remaining Work

### 1. PHC Handler Interface
Currently, PHC-specific information is not displayed in the web interface because there's no PHCHandler interface defined. To complete this:

1. Define a PHCHandler interface in `internal/protocols/interfaces.go`
2. Ensure `phcHandler` implements this interface  
3. Update web server to use the interface

### 2. Metrics Implementation
The HTTP server had placeholder metrics code that was simplified during fixes. Consider implementing proper metrics collection:
- Source-specific metrics (packets sent/received, sync count, etc.)
- Historical data tracking
- Performance metrics

### 3. Enhanced Priority Logic
The current priority logic uses weight as a proxy. Consider implementing proper primary/secondary source tracking based on the configuration structure that already exists (`PrimaryClocks` and `SecondaryClocks` arrays).

## Conclusion
All critical compilation issues have been resolved. The ShiwaTime application now builds successfully and maintains the advanced timing functionality that was implemented. The fixes preserve the sophisticated PTP, PPS, and PHC protocol implementations while ensuring proper interface compatibility throughout the system.
